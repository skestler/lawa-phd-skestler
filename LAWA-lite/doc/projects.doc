:document:    lawa::projects

LAWA has in the meanwhile been successfully used to realize several projects:


- many examples of the book __Wavelet Methods for Elliptic Partial Differential Equations__, (Karsten Urban, OUP) have been realized with LAWA.
- "A Wavelet Tour of Option Pricing", (__pdf__, thesis of Mario Rometsch)
- "Wavelets in der Optik", thesis of Philipp Jester
- "__On the adaptive tensor product wavelet Galerkin method with applications in finance__", thesis of Sebastian Kestler
